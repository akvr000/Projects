# Arduino

Arduino is an open-source electronics platform combining a microcontroller and a development environment for interactive projects. It reads inputs and converts them to outputs, supported by extensive community resources.
## Flame Detector
- Developed a fire detection system using Arduino, IR sensor, and LED.
- Implemented real-time monitoring and alert mechanisms for safety purposes.##
## Pulse Sensor
- Created a heart rate monitoring application using Arduino and a pulse sensor.
- Processed bio-signals to calculate and display beats per minute (BPM) on a Serial Monitor.
## Social Distance Detector
- Designed a social distancing alert system using Arduino and ultrasonic sensors.
- Configured LED alerts to ensure safe distancing.
