## Arduino

Arduino is an open-source electronics platform combining a microcontroller and a development environment for interactive projects. It reads inputs and converts them to outputs, supported by extensive community resources.
### Flame Detector
- Developed a fire detection system using Arduino, IR sensor, and LED.
- Implemented real-time monitoring and alert mechanisms for safety purposes.##
### Pulse Sensor
- Created a heart rate monitoring application using Arduino and a pulse sensor.
- Processed bio-signals to calculate and display beats per minute (BPM) on a Serial Monitor.
### Social Distance Detector
- Designed a social distancing alert system using Arduino and ultrasonic sensors.
- Configured LED alerts to ensure safe distancing.

### Getting Started
1. Install the Arduino IDE from [here](https://www.arduino.cc/en/software).
2. Clone this repository: `git clone https://github.com/akvr000/Projects.git`
3. Open the project in Arduino IDE.
4. Upload the code to your Arduino board.

### Usage
1. Connect the Arduino to the required sensors and relays.
2. Check pulse rate and have more fun with flame and social distance detector.
